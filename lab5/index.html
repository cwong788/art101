					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to work in Javascript with variables such as booleans and outputting to the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that came up was the browser console frequently had red error pop ups. I solved the issue by restarting the console and doing Task 1 over again. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment was not too difficult. I forgot what car I had at home so I had to ask my family. I didn't have a photo of the car so I used one from the internet.</p>
