					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to try and change/add to the HTML document using Javascript. For this lab, we added a button that added a div with random text in it anytime it was pressed. We also altered the CSS to alternate the text div.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was that my code to generate text using the button wasn't working at first, but I figured out that I had to move the code from part 4 and 5 into the code from part 3 in Task 3.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult for me since it has been building up from the previous labs, and lab 9 was really similar to this one. One new thing I learned was how to change the styling of elements in an alternating pattern.</p>
