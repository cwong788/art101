			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to try using Javascript events and input fields that let the user input into a text form.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was the discrepancy in instructions for Task 2, part 6. The instructions say to append but the red code example actually replaces instead. I decided to follow the instructions and change .html to .append since replacing it meant I could only input once, which did not seem correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was similar to previous labs in that a lot of the code was given to us, so it was not too difficult. The only difficulty was that problem I mentioned above, which I did not take too long to resolve since the previous labs taught me how to append to the document instead of replacing.</p>
