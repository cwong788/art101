			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with functions in Javascript, and printing the sorted name onto the webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was that the website would prompt me twice for my name, but only sort the name I entered the first time. I figured out that it was because I was triggering the javascript twice since the old files linked the javascript at the top already. I fixed this issue by turning that line into a comment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was not that difficult for me because I have worked with Javascript functions before. I did have that problem with the name prompt triggering twice, but it did not take me too long to figure out how to fix it. My partner and I decided to do part 4 for Task X together, and I had some free time so I tried to do the other parts too for fun.</p>
