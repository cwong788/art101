			<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to try experimenting with loops in Javascript, outputting numbers if they meet a certain condition.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not have any major problems with this lab. I did have a slightly hiccup where I forgot that I needed to print every number and not just the ones that are multiples of 3, 5, 7, but I caught this pretty quickly and did not have a hard time fixing it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult for me because it was based on the exercise we did in class.</p>
