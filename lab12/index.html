			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to try experimenting with conditionals in Javascript, using the user input to get a name to sort them into a house via the number of letters in the name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was the discrepancy between the instructions and the example screenshot. The instructions say to, for example, get the string as an argument for the function. Howevr, the example picture gets the string in the click listener and sends the number of letters to the function directly instead. I decided to follow the instructions since the pictures may just be out of sync and not updated with the instructions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult since there were example screenshots to help guide me on what to do, and it also builds upon the material of the previous labs, so I knew how to use the input and event listener.</p>
