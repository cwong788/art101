			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with anonymous functions and callbacks in both the browser console and Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was trying to figure out how to see my results for Task 3. I figured out how to do it by looking at the next task and its example image and realizing that the instructions meant to open the HTML file with LiveShare to see the results in the browser console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult for me since I have had a bit of experience with anonymous functions and callbacks before, but I am still intimidated by them. I think this lab is helping me relearn it since I learnt it on my own that time and my foundation wasn't as solid.</p>
