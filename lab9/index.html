					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuery, which is a Javascript library. The goal was to add buttons that toggle special attributes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was some confusion with the instructions, which says to put buttons on the challenge, problems, and results sections but doesn't mention the reflections section. I decided to put a button there anyway since I think there may be discrepancies with the old instructions and updated repository.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult for me since I have used Javascript libraries before, but it was a very good refresher since it has been a long time since I've done so.</p>
