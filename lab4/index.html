			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to practice problem solving and writing pseudocode for a task and a simple game. The goal was to write the tasks from a high-level without going into the nitty-gritty weeds.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose was the inconsistency in the instruction for how to write the author block. In the linked example, it used astericks and back-slashes, but the picture shown below the instructions used two back-slashes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment was not too difficult for me because I am familiar with the concept of pseudocoding. I did have to stop myself and make an effort to not go into the weeds and details of actual programming details, but I think I did well in doing so.</p>
