			<h1>Lab 6 Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with arrays and objects in Javascript, and outputting them into the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose was myTransport did not print in a nice format the first time I did it. To fix this problem, I printed each element inside the array and separated them by spaces.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was not too difficult for me because I already knew about arrays and objects from previous classes. Printing the object using JSON.stringify was new to me. I wasn't sure if I needed to add a semicolon at the end when referencing an element in an array, so I was surprised I did not need to.</p>
