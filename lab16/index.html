					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to try and use an API and AJAX to fetch data from an external website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a major problem trying to get the website to return a success. It kept giving me an error that my request was blocked by CORS policy. After my partner sent an email to the TA, we were recommended to try using the CORS unblock pluging, which fixed the issue.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was difficult because I kept getting that error I mentioned above and all the solutions I kept trying from stackoverflow were not working. Most suggested solutions did not use the ajax call so I could not even use those.</p>
