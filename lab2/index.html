					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to create and edit HTML and CSS files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose was the discrepancies between the instructions and example labs. For example, the instructions state the create the file, but the file already exists in the repository. We solved this issue by asking a section TA for whether to follow the instructions or the examples, to which they replied that either is okay.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
